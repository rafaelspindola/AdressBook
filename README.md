# Contact List

## Briefing

This was a project designed to learn and optimize my abilities regarding CRUD APIs and making a connection to a database (MySQL). 
It was intended to simulate a contact list related to professional programming information: 

- Name
- Phone number
- Email 
- State (Brazil) 
- Linkedin profile 
- Programming languages that they work with

## Dependencies
- Lombok
- MySQL Driver 
- Spring Web
- Spring Data JPA

## Packages
- Controller: is a mediator between the user and the app, receiving input and converting it to a model or a view. Contains methods and functions related to HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- Model: is the app's data structure. 
- Repository: stores data, preparing it for retrieval by requests in the controller.

## What I've learned in this project

First, I've educated myself into creating methods and functions concerning http requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). 
Furthermore, I've comprehended how to create databases in MySQL through shell comands, while also learning how to set up MySQL local server in my PC.
Last but not least, I've understood how to link my app in IntelliJ and the local database server hosted by MySQL.
